# Unhandled Error in Asynchronous Express.js Middleware

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled errors within asynchronous middleware.  The provided `bug.js` file contains a simple Express.js server that simulates an asynchronous operation.  Sometimes, this operation throws an error, causing the server to crash without proper error handling.

The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to fix this issue by using `try...catch` blocks or dedicated error-handling middleware to gracefully handle exceptions and prevent crashes.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Refresh the page several times. Eventually, the server will crash due to the unhandled error.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the fixed version.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in asynchronous operations within Express.js to maintain application stability.
